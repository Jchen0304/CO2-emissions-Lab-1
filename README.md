# rise in CO2-emissions around the world(Lab-1)

Describtion: Using the greenhouse gas emission data in owid-co2-data.csv from "Our World in Data", the purpose of this project is to determine how the emission levels of the current top 10 CO2 emitters have changed over the last 50 years (from 1971 - 2020). By importing the data to phython and processing the data with different codes, the results showed a tread in the co2 emissions of top emitters from different countries of a exponential rise throughout the last 50 years. 

Requirements section: the software that was used to compute the data was Phython. This software will effectively create different graphs/plots from the data that was imported from the source, as well as organizing the data such as top values of certain categories or finding means/medians of the data.

Data section: The source was will be used in this project comes from the greenhouse gas emission data set found in owid-co2-data.csv from "Our World in Data". This source provides data of how the emission levels of the current top 10 CO2 emitters have changed over the last 50 years (from 1971 to 2020). 

Data Processing section: Many data processing methods was used in the project to better understand the change in co2 emissions of different countries over the pass 50 years. This includes making a timeplot, boxplot, histogram, and log-scale plot. 

Authors section: The author of this project is Jianjun Chen, a civil engineering major student at Seattle University.
